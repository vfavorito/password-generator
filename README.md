# Password Generator Javascript

## Random Password Generator

### Overview:
In this repository I created a random password generator.  The generator is designed to take information given by the user and with this information give a password that meets the user's requirements.  The Criteria used in the password are password length, and whether you wanna use lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. This was primarily accomplished using Javascript prompts, for loops, functions, and if/else statements.  

## How it works!

### The process goes Like this:
### Click Generate Password Button
